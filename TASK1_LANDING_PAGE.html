                    We are a group of people who continuously work in the field of art and paintings.We want people to
                    develop interest towards painting which helps them to release their emotions.It can be difficult to
                    communicate your feelings. This is especially true with challenging feelings like anger and grief.
                    Trauma is very difficult to articulate, too. Many psychologists recommend art therapy for their
                    clients. It helps release your feelings without words and puts you in a more regulated, relaxed
                    state. Looking at paintings and learning about artists who struggled with their emotions can help,
                    too. It’s cathartic to see representations of emotions on canvas.This Website let people know about
                    the importance and benefits of doing paintings and also helps us to know how it effect our mental
                    health.

                        <h3>IMPORTANCE OF DOING PAINTING</h3>
                        <p>1 Paintings increase cultural appreciation
                            Learning about (and appreciating) different cultures comes with many benefits. It’s also
                            part of living in the world as a global citizen. Studying paintings is a good way to develop
                            cultural appreciation, especially for young people who may not have much exposure to other
                            cultures beyond their own. True cultural appreciation goes beyond looking at a painting.
                            It’s also important to dig into the context of an art style, who the artist was, and what
                            they were trying to communicate.</p>
                        <p>

                            2 Painting boosts creativity
                            When you paint, you’re using both sides of your brain. Experts used to think that people
                            were either “left-brained” or “right-brained,” and that creativity was found on the right
                            side. New research suggests that’s not the case. Following a stroke that affected the left
                            side of his brain, an artist struggled to make new art. He eventually regained the motor
                            skills necessary to draw, but while he could copy images, coming up with something original
                            was difficult. Researchers believed this showed that both sides of the brain were involved
                            in creating art. The more you paint, the more you use your entire brain and improve your
                            creative skills.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            3 Painting can improve your focus
                            When you paint, you’re stimulating the parts of your brain responsible for concentration and
                            memory. For people with ADHD, which includes symptoms like struggling with focus, art
                            therapy can help them stay more engaged. To boost your brain’s ability to focus, try
                            painting with as few distractions as possible. If you’re studying a painting, focus your
                            brain by looking for focal points, interesting compositions, color patterns, and more.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                            4 Painting can improve problem-solving skills
                            When you take up painting, you know that skills like creativity and focus will most likely
                            improve. Painting can help you become a better problem-solver, too! Every artist makes
                            mistakes. Recognizing a mistake and figuring out how to fix it exercises the problem-solving
                            part of your brain. Painters are good at adapting and thinking outside the box. The more you
                            paint, the sharper your critical thinking and problem-solving skills become.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            5 Painting can improve self-esteem
                            Research indicates that when kids participate in the arts, they enjoy a boost of confidence
                            and self-esteem. They don’t even need to be particularly good at painting. One study,
                            published in the Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, took a look at 6,209 students
                            from the United Kingdom Millennium Cohort Study. Most of the data came from interviews when
                            they were 11-years old. Students who engaged in creative activities most days were more
                            likely to have high self-esteem than students who had fewer opportunities. The reasons why
                            aren’t quite clear, but the researchers believed it could be because creating art helps kids
                            form a unique identity and feel accomplished.

                        <h3>EFFECT OF PAINTING ON MENTAL HEALTH</h3>
                        <p>
                            1.Painting supports your emotional wellbeing
                            They say a picture says a thousand words, and painting can be a hugely cathartic experience,
                            allowing you to access feelings buried deep within your subconscious.

                            Painting can also help us deal with those feelings by giving them a physical shape, removing
                            the anguish involved when keeping feelings hidden. This is why psychologists often prescribe
                            art therapy for patients who have suffered psychological trauma: it helps to release
                            emotions in a safe, non-threatening environment.

                            By learning to better express yourself, through the medium of art, painting can be an act of
                            self-care that supports your emotional wellbeing.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            2.Stress Relief
                            Stress is proven to be detrimental for our physical and mental health. One of the best ways
                            to combat stress, is to make art! Study after study has shown that drawing, doodling,
                            coloring, and simply creating something for 20 plus minutes reduces cortisol. The best part
                            is that previous art experience is not required to reap these benefits.</p>
                        <p>

                            3.Boosts Self-Esteem
                            The consistent practice of art can build a sense of accomplishment for all ages in just 45
                            minutes. Creativity makes us feel good about ourselves. It validates our unique ideas and
                            our ability to turn ideas into something physical. Taking time for your hobbies and crafts
                            often provides a sense of self-worth and confidence in our abilities. So knit that sweater
                            and play that piano!
                        </p>
                        4.Healing
                        Healing from trauma is a complicated process and there are many practices that can help
                        facilitate this process. Research has proved that art can help process pain and provide a direct
                        connection between the mind and body to help with the healing process.

                        5.Expressive Therapy
                        Expressive arts, such as visual arts, movement, drama, music, and writing, foster deep personal
                        growth and community development. Expressive art therapy allows users to laugh, let go, and
                        relax, which helps decrease depression, anxiety, and stress.

                        <p>
                            Ways to Practice Self-Care through Art
                            .Use Art as a Release
                            A common exercise to utilize art for release is to first represent things you want to let go
                            of as words, drawings, colors, or images on a blank canvas. Then you can burn it, rip it up,
                            cover it up with something new that inspires you, throw it away, put it in water, or destroy
                            it in any way you please.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            .Respond through Art
                            In the same way that releasing through art can help us overcome difficulties, it can also be
                            used to cope with pain and negative feelings. Some examples include writing to a loved one
                            that hurt you or taking photos of a place that used to hold meaning to you. It is also
                            helpful to find a piece of art you connect with such as music, writing, or a painting, and
                            to then utilize this inspiration to create something of your own as an emotional response.
                            Understanding what you are trying to capture through this piece and breaking down how it
                            makes you feel can be beneficial to this analysis.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            .Mindful Creativity
                            Art doesn’t require thought, it can be a free-flowing creative process. To practice mindful
                            art, you can simply start creating or choose a piece of art as inspiration for your own
                            creation. Block out the other thoughts and distractions in your life and give yourself a set
                            amount of time to make art or enjoy it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            .Collage your Thoughts or Visions
                            Some people find it difficult or don’t enjoy the practice of drawing, painting, or writing
                            but there are endless ways to practice art. You can create a collage that expresses what
                            you’re feeling about a specific situation to process your emotions and thoughts. You may
                            also collage a vision board to focus on the future and use photos that excite you. All you
                            need are some magazines, newspapers, or old images around your house.
                        </p>

                            .Color a Feeling Wheel
                            Leah Guzman is an art therapist who wrote a book on further practices in essential art
                            therapy, and an exercise she champions is to develop a color feeling wheel to deal with
                            emotions. It starts by drawing a circle then dividing it into eighths and writing one
                            emotion in each section, then pick a color that represents that feeling and color the
                            section in. Afterwards, pay attention to which emotions were associated with which colors,
                            the feelings you wrote first, and how this is applicable to your everyday life.
